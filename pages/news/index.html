                          “I write really because I have to and if the writing also destroys some of those myths and subverts forms and makes people question the very idea of the writer, the woman, the Filipino-American, the whatever, great!” ~Jessica Hagedorn
                          <br><br>
                          Playwright, writer, poet, and multimedia performance artist Jessica Hagedorn was born and raised in the Philippines, moving to the U.S. with her mother as a teenager. It was then, at 14 years old, that she started to write poetry more seriously.
                          <br><br>
                          “I started writing seriously then. I had always written. As a child, I loved to read and I always thought of myself as a writer. You know, I was very dramatic. I would write little poems and I loved to make little comic books. I would illustrate them, four-page comic books, and thought of myself as a writer. When I was fourteen, my mother gave me a typewriter, thank heavens, and I guess she thought that would be a healthy way to keep me at home. I would type poems and read.”
                          <br><br>
                          Early on her focus was on writing poetry and plays, as well as making music. She moved to New York City in her late 20s to pursue these interests. Her first play was produced the same year. She’s since produced three more plays. Her mixed media style often incorporates song, poetry, images, and spoken dialogue.
                          <br><br>
                          Hagedorn received three MacDowell Colony fellowships, which helped enable her to write the novel Dogeaters, winner of the American Book Award and a finalist for the National Book Award. She later turned the book into a play by the same name. She’s written three other novels as well — Toxicology, Dream Jungle, and The Gangster Of Love. “What made me want to write a novel was reading One Hundred Years of Solitude by Garcia Marquez.” When asked what she brings to fiction from her background in poetry and music, she replies simply, “Rhythm. And I think the love of language, the sheer word play. I love words. The sound of words.”
                          <br><br>
                          Hagedorn has written a screenplay, scripts for TV, and for 10 years was the leader of a band called The Gangster Choir. Her list of honors and prizes is long, including a Gerbode, Hewlett Foundations’ Playwriting Award, a Lucille Lortel Playwrights’ Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fiction Fellowship, a Kesselring Prize Honorable Mention for Dogeaters, an NEA-TCG Playwriting Residency Fellowship, as well as fellowships from the Sundance Playwrights’ Lab and the Sundance Screenwriters’ Lab. She’s taught in the MFA Playwriting Program at Yale, and in the MFA Creative Writing Program at LIU Brooklyn, NYU and Columbia University.

                          It takes time to develop your craft. It might seem tempting to rush into publishing, and it’s hard not to think about the publishing process even as you’re writing. But when you’re starting out, I hope you can enjoy exploring your writing for the sake of the writing, and not the finished product that you can sell to others. Spend time understanding what you love about stories. Find authors you like, who are doing what you want to be doing. Read their work carefully. Copy their sentences down, if writing good sentences is something that matters to you. That tactile exercise makes a difference. (While you’re at it, if the author you admire is living, send them fanmail! I’m sure they’ll appreciate it.)
                          <br><br>
                          Learn how to critique work. If you’re in school, get involved with your literary folio. If you’re out of school, apply for workshops, or try to find a local or online writing group. Understand how to specify what you like in a story and what you think can be improved. Critiquing others is a great way to improve your own craft. This can also help you find community, which has been a critical part of my journey. I think it would’ve been incredibly difficult for me to stick with writing if I didn’t have writer-friends.
                          <br><br>
                          If you want to write Filipino stories, read what’s out there, then figure out what story you want to read that doesn’t exist yet, and give it a shot. It might be really hard at first. When I was in high school and college I mostly wrote fanfiction, or retellings of Western myths and fairytales. That meant I was primarily writing Japanese or American or European characters. I didn’t know how to write Filipinos. I could write a blonde mermaid, or a schoolgirl named Sakura, but I couldn’t write about a girl living in Manila named Isa. At the same time a lot of the stories I was reading for Eng Lit or Fil Lit classes were very depressing and heavy, and I had a desire to subvert that. I found some ways of doing so by writing speculative fiction, but that’s not the only avenue. If you’re struggling, something that might help is simply focusing on writing the story you want to write. Since you’re Filipino, something in the story will be Filipino.
                          <br><br>
                          Lastly: I hope that you try not to let it go. I hope you keep doing it. It’s hard to keep writing when there’s so little reward. If there’s something inside you that wants to write, I hope you stick with it, that you persevere. I want more of our stories out there.

                          In his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur runs into Sadie Green on a subway platform. They’ve known each other since childhood, when they first bonded over a shared love of video games, but a rift set them apart. In Gabrielle Zevin’s inventive and sweeping novel, the estranged friends reconnect and rebuild their relationship, becoming creative partners on a video game that shoots them to fame before they turn 25. As Sam and Sadie wrestle with their growing ambitions over the years, they cultivate a friendship much more meaningful than any romance. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a celebration of the narratives, in video games and in life, that reinforce just how important connection really is. In following Sam and Sadie’s journey from Massachusetts to California and into the imagined worlds of their games, Zevin writes the most precious kind of love story.

                            When I was eight years old! I wrote this oddball of a horror story about a girl who could turn into a chicken. It was a handwritten piece on a few sheets of letter-sized paper, folded into a book and stapled at the spine. There was only one copy, and unfortunately, the ridiculous tale has fallen victim to the passage of time, lost in a sea of random junk I've gathered over the years. Since then, I've always written stories, whether for myself or for fanfiction fandoms way back when. I just can't imagine living a life without writing anything!
                            <br><br>
                            YA has always been my first love, so it was important for me to keep the story in that same genre. My previous works have all been contemporary, so for Of Myths and Men, I wanted to let my imagination go wild and explore worlds outside the ordinary but still very much grounded in the world we live in today - hence the low fantasy genre.

                            As for the main theme, there's a sense of found family here, finding where you belong and that what makes you different is what makes you unique. It's all about embracing what you love (which, in my protagonist's case, is video games) and using that as your personal tool to do good in your own way. I'm an avid gamer myself, and my day job is actually as a games journalist, so I'm in that headspace all the time!

                          An unnamed writer arrives in London for a trip. She feels her recently deceased mother’s absence—and presence—everywhere she goes. As she walks around the city, she’s reminded of her mother’s complicated life, the memories they shared, and the curious, ever-evolving relationship between child and parent. But, the unnamed writer repeats, even though she’s constructing a deeply felt tribute to her mother, this is, in no way, a memoir. Her mother hated those. And so goes Elizabeth McCracken’s latest work of fiction, poking holes in the very idea of fiction itself as the story unfolds. The prolific author, whose own mother shared many similarities with the one described in the book, delivers a potent meditation on processing loss. Along the way, she makes startling revelations about what it really means to write, and how fiction can help us understand the most challenging parts of life.

                          Agnès has just heard the news that her childhood best friend, Fabienne, is dead. Now an adult living in America, Agnès reflects on growing up in France with Fabienne by her side and a decision Fabienne made that changed both their lives: when they were kids in the war-ravaged countryside, Fabienne wrote a fictional account of their experiences, and published it under Agnès’ name. The move catapulted Agnès to literary fame—and to a London finishing school where she suffered tremendously without Fabienne nearby—and now, she’s finally ready to tell her version of the events that defined her adolescence. Yiyun Li dissects the girls’ achingly intimate and, at times, unsettling friendship, and asks if Agnès ever really knew the person she was so devoted to. In detailing the answer, she unveils a cutting portrait of girlhood.

                          In Sarah Thankam Mathews’ tender debut novel All This Could Be Different, a finalist for a 2022 National Book Award, recent college graduate Sneha has just moved to Milwaukee and started an awful job as a corporate consultant. Though the work is soul-crushing, there’s a recession swirling and the money keeps Sneha afloat. Plus, she can send some of it to her parents in India. But Mathews’ contemplative protagonist is desperately lonely in this new life, despite a burgeoning romance with an older ballet dancer named Marina. As Sneha questions why she finds it so difficult to open up to others, she is forced to confront the inescapable trauma that she’s buried deep inside. Mathews explores this tension, and the community that Sneha builds for herself in the Midwest, in an incisive and surprising coming-of-age narrative.

Due to her parent’s love for books, her home was filled with books. She grew up in an environment where she saw books around her. J.K. Rowling has a sister. Their parents used to read different books to their daughters. When Rowling was six years old, she wrote her first book. It was actually a horror story named ‘Rabbit.’ She wrote another short story named ‘The Seven Cursed Diamonds’ when she was 11 years old. 
                          <br><br>
                          Rowling became an avid reader in her childhood. Because her mom was diagnosed with a disease, she had to give up on her job. Due to her mother’s illness, her teenage years went into suffering.
                          <br><br>
                          Education
                          Not only was she an avid reader, but also a bright student. She was very good at her academic studies. J.K. Rowling was also interested in learning other languages than English. She went to Paris and earned a bachelor of arts degree in French in 1987.

                          She had written numerous books on the Harry Potter series including her first novel. Harry Potter was her most prominent work that is loved worldwide. Her other novel, The Cuckoo’s Calling (2013), was also a bestseller. It was a crime thriller. The fun fact about her Harry Potter novel is that it was rejected several times before it was published.

                          If a movie is based on a novel, it’s a good novel. John Green is a young American author, now in his 40s, and has written the novel The Fault in Our Stars. Another bestseller novel. A movie is based on his novel too. Like his novel, the movie was also a hit and a huge box office success. Besides this, his novel Paper Town also got a movie on it.
                          <br><br>
                          Awards Won by John Green
                          John Green has won several awards for his novels and also for his notable other works. He received four awards for his three novels. One of his novels won two different awards, which was quite an achievement. He also received one award for the content he makes online. We’ll talk about it in the upcoming sections.
                          <br><br>
                          Early Life of John Green
                          Like the above two authors we discussed, John Green didn’t start writing when he was a child. He worked as a clerk in a hospital as his first job. In his teen life, when he was studying, he used to get bullied by his fellows. He stated that this made his life miserable at that point. The fun fact is that the above two authors we discussed also got bullied in their school, college, or university lives.
                          <br><br>
                          John Green did double graduation, one in English language and another in Religious studies, from Kenyon College in 2000. He thought about becoming a priest, but as he worked in a hospital and saw children suffering and fighting diseases, he chose to become an author. Eventually, he wrote the novel The Fault in Our Stars, which is based on the same topic—two people afflicted with Cancer.
                          <br><br>
                          Famous Books of John Green
                          The fault in our stars which was published in the year 2012, was the most successful work of John Green. Another novel he published, Looking for Alaska in 2005, was also a bestseller. It was his first novel, and he won an award for it. It’s a great accomplishment for a writer to win an award for his debut book. His other novels were also successful and got awards, and one of them was only nominated for the awards.

                          What is John Green Interested in?
                          If you get to know about the activities John Green has been involved in, you might think about how he got time to write best-selling novels. But he’s an all-rounder who managed all the things at once and even made them successful. However, once, he had to take a break from social media because he wanted to work on his book.

                          You said: In this groundbreaking novel, completed after six arduous years of research, Capote invented a new genre - the 'Nonfiction Novel' - applying prose techniques to fact. It spawned the school of New Journalism & invented the true crime genre as we know it.

                          Nothing fuels a writer quite like heartbreak, whether they produce a book or viral Facebook memes. In Jade Mark Capiñanes’ case, it’s both. “How to Grieve,” which is the Palanca winner’s first book, is a short story collection written before, during, and after a breakup — and while the stories contain the humor and sardonicism many readers expect, Capiñanes clarifies in an interview that they’re more about “things like unprocessed grief, emotions we repress or fail to articulate — basically things you don’t talk about at parties but cry about after.”

                        In a coincidence timed so perfectly it convinced me God has a sense of humor (or, perhaps more accurately, that the gears of the capitalist-patriarchy will continue turning ad infinitum), the question that “The Reddest Rose Unfolds” poses is: Why does Leonardo DiCaprio date an endless string of 20-something models? This graphic novel retraces the history of romantic love, aiming to predict if it truly has a place in a world obsessed with rationalism and ridden by consumerism.

                          A writer deeply concerned with social justice, F. Sionil Jose’s novels have been translated into 22 languages, and he’s one of the most widely read Filipino authors. Sionil Jose’s Rosales Saga is a five-volume work that follows the Samson family and their changing fortunes over a 100-year timeframe. Sionil Jose’s books are especially illuminating for anyone interested in provincial life in the Philippines, the revolution against Spain, and the framework of the Filipino family. His anti-elitist views have made him a somewhat unpopular author within the Philippines, but Sionil Jose’s works are among the most highly acclaimed internationally of any Filipino writer. He won the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Literature in 1980.
